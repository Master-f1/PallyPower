#### PallyPower Warn ####

Author: Trelis @ Proudmoore

This addon is designed for the Paladin class to work with PallyPower.

Configuration is under Interface->Addons->PallyPowerWarn, or can be brought
up with "/ppw ui" or "/ppwarn ui".  Command line help can be accessed by
"/ppw" or "/ppwarn".

Warnings can be enabled for:
	* Blessings
	* Seals
	* Righteous Fury
	* Auras

Checks can be performed:
	* When Blessings and Seals expire
	* On /readycheck
	* On entering combat
	* On leaving combat

Warning types:
	* Sound
	* Custom Window (moveable)
	* Scrolling combat text
	* Chat Frame (configurable which frame)

Of course you can choose for yourself which functions you want.

Tip: You can use your mouse scroll wheel over your aura, seal, and blessings in PallyPower to cycle through
them.  To toggle Righteous Fury on and off in PallyPower hold down shift and scroll your mousewheel over your
seal line.

PallyPowerWarn will not warn you if another paladin has buffed your assigned buffs.  This is intentional as
maybe you have more paladins than you need to provide all the blessings and someone else buffed for you.  It
would be bad if this addon did warn about it and two paladins using this addon played tag with rebuffing.

It is built on Ace3 for increased efficiency and performance, with low memory
footprint.

As of r22:
Memory usage: 163K
CPU usage: very little (I would have to measure it in ms per hour)
