Applied the same 1 second delay for checking Seal fade as for blessings so that you no longer get warned about your seal fading when you die.

   M /trunk/PallyPowerWarn.lua

When a buff fades from a player, delay checking them 1 second to see if they died.  Checking immediately wasn't working as the buff fading can be in the combatlog before the death and if you check if they are alive on the buff fade event they are still alive.

Previous versions of PallyPowerWarn only checked if the PallyPower assigned buff was on a player.  Now if the assigned blessing isn't present, PallyPowerWarn checks to see if you have the wrong blessing on that player and an option to warn on wrong blessings. No longer warns about the correct buff fading when you manually cast the wrong blessing on someone (we will assume it is intentional).  Added more comments in the code.

   A /trunk/doc.txt

Added doc.txt. Removed AceTimer library and added CallbackHandler.  Checking Imps only when not phase shifted wasn't working well, sometimes they would phase shift right after you check them which would be annoying.  So now we just ignore warning about buffing Imps.
